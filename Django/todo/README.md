This project is based on [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/4RWFvXDUmjo) which is made by dennis ivy

I learnded some django's fundamental and knew how to perform basic CRUD operations.

Basically I just made some changes on the styling of the website (even though it is quite bad). Others like features and logics are still following the video.
