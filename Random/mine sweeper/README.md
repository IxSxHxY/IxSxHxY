<h1>Minesweeper</h1>
This (small) project/tutorial is fully done by myself
<br>
Control:
<ul>
  <li>Left-click to open the tile</li>
  <li>Right-click to place the flag</li>
  <li>R to restart</li>
</ul>

Currently not providing options for players to change the parameters like width and height. This feature might be added during the next update(maybe)

To play the game, use the command
<code>py minesweeper.py</code>
